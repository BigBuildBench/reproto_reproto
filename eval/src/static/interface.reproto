//! # Example of an interface in reproto
//!
//! Interfaces are safe, polymorphic types, which uses some mechanism for determining which
//! sub-type is actually being references.
//!
//! They expose _two_ types, the interface itself, and all its sub-types.
//! Sub-types are references as child types of an interface. Like, `Interface::SubType`.

/// A source of data.
interface Source {
  /// The name of the source, this is available to all sub-types.
  name: string;

  /// A file source.
  File as "file" {
    /// The path to the file.
    path: string;
  }

  /// A URL source.
  Url as "url" {
    /// The url to get the source from.
    url: string;

    /// Timeout for which we can request the URL.
    fetch_timeout: u64;
  }
}
